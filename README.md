coppied much of the code from gpskwlkr/nixos-hyprland-flake as I was struggling with some of the hyperland configs.

### main differences
* no secure boot.
* not going to use home manager. Trying to impliment a dotfile repo in TryHardConfigs
* removed some of the packages, don't remember each one.
* changed a lot of the dotfiles to be my own.
